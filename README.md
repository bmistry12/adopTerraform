# ADOP Terraform

This is a project to migrate [ADOP](https://github.com/Accenture/adop-docker-compose) from CloudFormation to Terraform. 

The CloudFormation script can be found in [here](https://github.com/bmistry12/adopTerraform/blob/master/scripts/service-adop-c.yaml)

With this you can successfully spin up ADOP-C using AWS.
